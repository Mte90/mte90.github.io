 
I'm Daniele Scasciafratte a Mozilla volounteer, member of Mozilla Italia.  
My jobs in the community are many from mentor for new volunteers as a speaker or developer or translator.  
Today at the meetup at 18:40 will be a Q&A time about the Mozilla World and the italian community. I introduce the events of the last year in Italy and for this year, the "Guida sviluppo veloce firefox os" and task of our community for the italian users.
There will also be the gadget only for today for those who participate and the chance to try the Firefox OS devices.
The meetup will be in italian but there are no problem for talk in english.
